# Telco_Customer_Churn
Telco Customer Churn Prediction ðŸ“Š | This project analyzes customer behavior to predict churn using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib. Goal: Help telecom companies improve customer retention. ðŸš€
ðŸ“Š Project Workflow:
âœ… Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding customer behavior through visualizations and statistical insights.
âœ… Feature Engineering: Selecting and engineering features to improve model performance.
âœ… Machine Learning Models: Training and evaluating multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
âœ… Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Machine Learning Algorithms
Power BI / Tableau (Optional for visualization)
ðŸš€ Goal:
The goal of this project is to help telecom companies identify at-risk customers and implement strategies to improve customer retention.
